git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies:
npm install
3. Running Tests
To run all tests in headless mode:
npx cypress run
To run tests in the Cypress Test Runner:

4. Generating Reports
After running the tests, Mochawesome reports will be generated in the cypress/reports/ directory.
🛠️ Configuration
Cypress Configuration (cypress.config.js)
You can modify test configurations in the cypress.config.js file. Key settings include:

Base URL
Default timeouts
Integration folder for test cases
Mochawesome Reporter
The Mochawesome configuration is included in the package.json:

"mocha": {
  "reporter": "mochawesome",
  "reporterOptions": {
    "reportDir": "cypress/reports",
    "overwrite": false,
    "html": true,
    "json": true
  }
}
🔍 Test Reporting
Viewing Mochawesome Reports
After running tests, reports are generated in cypress/reports/.
Open the mochawesome.html file in your browser to view the detailed test results.
✅ Best Practices
Use descriptive test names.
Keep page objects simple and reusable.
Utilize Cypress's built-in commands like cy.intercept() for mocking API calls.
Organize test data in the fixtures/ folder.
